# Hi! Welcome to my blog.
This post will explain how i made this blog your on right now.

## The Framework
So as you may be able to tell by the blog, i don't have much experience making a blog. So how did i find what framework to use?
Well one google search of "HOW TO CODE BLOG QUICK AAAA" later i found [a guide](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/setup-project-for-blog-in-fastest-way-part-1-54e6d47e2c44). It told me to use [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a simple but powerful framework. So i set out to make my ~~bad~~ blog!

## The ~~Spaghetti~~ Code
Well it turns out [Hexo](https://hexo.io) has themes! So [hippidy hopidy your code is now my property](https://github.com/ChrAlpha/hexo-theme-cards) (thank you [ChrAlpha](https://github.com/ChrAlpha)). So after ~~stealing~~ borrowing some code i edited the `config.yml`, added [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro) (all hail monokai pro) and wrote this post.

# Well Thats All Folks
